# pysaintcoinach

A Python port of the popular [Saint Coinach](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach) library for extracting game assets and reading game assets from **Final Fantasy XIV**.

This library aims to provide a complete Python implementation of the C# library, attempting to showcase all the potential of the Python programming language, and to enable quick development of scripts for other projects.

Special thanks to @[ufx](https://github.com/ufx) and all contributors to the Saint Coinach library.

## Functionality

### Fully implemented and maintained

* Extraction of files from the game's SqPack files based on their friendly name (or by identifiers, if preferred).
* Conversion of the game's textures to `PIL`-based objects, using `Pillow`.
* Parsing and reading from the game's data files (`*.exh` and `*.exd`).
* Decoding of OGG files stored in the game's pack files.

### Partially implemented

* OO-representation of select game data.
* Decoding of the string format used by the game.

### Not implemented or ported

* Self-updating feature. This port relies on the original Saint Coinach library for `ex.json` mappings.

## Cloning this Repo

This repo makes use of submodules. When cloning, please include the `--recurse-submodules` option.

## Usage

Those familiar with Saint Coinach will find the API to be mostly unchanged; however, since this is a Python implementation, most, if not all the API is written in Pythonic form. Only class names have remained unchanged. Methods and properties are written in PEP-8 complient format, i.e. `SaintCoinach.Ex.Language.English` becomes `pysaintcoinach.ex.Language.english`, and properties such as `ARealmReversed.GameData` become `ARealmReversed.game_data`. Where possible, Pythonic representations of collections are used. As such, this library is only compatible with Python 3.X.

### Set-up

It's recommended you run `pysaintcoinach` with a virtual environment. A `requirements.txt` is provided to install the necessary 3rd-party modules.

```cmd
python3 -m venv pyvirt
.\pyvirt\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All important data is exposed by the `pysaintcoinach.ARealmReversed` class, so setting up access to it is fairly straightforward.

The following is an example using the game's default installation path and English as the default language:

```python
import pysaintcoinach

GAME_DIRECTORY = r"C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn"
realm = pysaintcoinach.ARealmReversed(GAME_DIRECTORY, pysaintcoinach.ex.Language.english)
```

Alternatively, a special helper function is available for default installations which includes fixups for certain string tags:

```python
import pysaintcoinach

realm = pysaintcoinach.get_default_xiv()
```

### Accessing data

Game files can be accessed directly through `ARealmReversed.packs`. Game data can be accessed through `ARealmReversed.game_data`.

#### Game Data (`XivCollection`)

Each game data table (or sheet) is accessed using the `get_sheet(name)` method. For some collections, an OO-representation is available. Regardless of that, you can access mapped fields in a number of ways.

The following is a simple example that outputs the name and description of all `Weather` objects to the console:

```python
weathers = realm.game_data.get_sheet('Weather')
for weather in weathers:
    print("#{:>3}: {} -> {}".format(weather.key, weather.name, weather.description))
```

Next, we see how sheets are related. The following example outputs the available pet actions for each pet. This should give you an idea of just how useful this library can be.

```python
from itertools import groupby
from operator import methodcaller, itemgetter

# Filter out any actions which do not have a name, then sort by Pet id for grouping.
sorted_pet_actions = sorted(filter(lambda row: row.as_string('Name') != "",
                                   realm.game_data.get_sheet('PetAction')),
                            key=methodcaller('get_raw', 'Pet'))

for pet, pet_actions in groupby(sorted_pet_actions, key=itemgetter('Pet')):
    pet_name = pet['Name']
    if pet_name == "":
        pet_name = "all pets"
    print("Actions for {}:".format(pet_name))
    for pet_action in pet_actions:
        if pet_action.get_raw('Action') == 0:
            print("       {}: {}".format(pet_action['Name'],
                                         pet_action['Description']))
        else:
            print("  Lv{:<2} {}: {}".format(pet_action['Action']['ClassJobLevel'],
                                            pet_action['Name'],
                                            pet_action['Description']))
    print("")
```

As a bonus, the `pysaintcoinach.exdhelper.ExdHelper` class can dump an entire sheet or row to a dictionary for interactive inspection. Keep in mind, although it may look like certain field values are mere strings, if they came from a linked sheet, the actual value is the entire row. That said, you should not use `ExdHelper` as your primary method of reading data as it is far less efficient.

## Notes

### Documentation

Aside from this readme, there's not much in the way of function documentation. As with the original Saint Coinach library, there should be enough documentation available to know how to use the library for game data, but figuring out the internal working... yea, it's a challenge.

## xivshell Module

The `xivshell` module is a Python port of `SaintCoinach.Cmd`.  It is a very basic console application that can be used to extract various assets. The following commands are currently supported:

* `lang`: Displays or changes the language used for data files. Valid arguments are: `ja` (Japanese), `en` (English), `de` (German), or `fr` (French). If no argument is supplied, the currently used language is shown.
* `raw`: Exports a file from the game assets without any conversions. The argument should be the friendly name of the file.
* `image`: Exports a file from the game assets as a PNG-image. The argument should be the friendly name of the image file.
* `ui`: Exports one or multiple UI icons as PNG-images. The argument can either be the number of a single UI icon, or the first and last number for a range of icons separated by a space. Valid numbers are in the interval \[0, 999999\].
* `exd`: Exports all or a specified number of game data sheets as CSV-files. Arguments can either be empty to export all files, or a list of sheet names separated by whitespace.
* `rawexd`: Exports all or a specified number of game data sheets as CSV-files without post-processing applied. Arguments can either be empty to export all files, or a list of sheet names separated by whitespace.
* `bgm`: Exports all sound files referenced in the BGM sheet as OGG-files.
